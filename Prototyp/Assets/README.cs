 *  This project is the practice project for the Game Productions course in the second part of summer semester 23.
 *  In the folder Paulander Spezis you will find all the folders on which the group members of the Paulander Spezis team are actively working. 
 *  The top level asset folders of this project should not be edited as they contain sample assets and libraries.
 *  Changes to prefabs should be made within the prefab and not within the scene in which the prefab was placed.
